                    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                    <p>Come solve a crazy design problem at Uncommon Makes! In this second-ever UChicago designathon, you will have six hours to respond to a design prompt. The twist is: unlike at our hackathon, your solution does not have to be a technical product. Mock-ups, prototypes, sketches, drawings, and even interpretive dances are all fair game! What our judges will be looking for the most is how creatively and thoughtfully your team responded to the prompt.</p>

                    <h1>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
                    <p>Once you arrive at the event, you‚Äôll have a chance to meet new people and form teams. Then, during our opening ceremony, we'll announce the prompt for this year's Makes. After the keynote, we‚Äôll start our two workshops that introduce you to two technologies that could help with your project:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you're looking for a more design-heavy approach, we will have a workshop for Figma, which is a tool for creating design mock-ups. </li>
                        <li>If you're looking for a more code-heavy approach, we will have a workshop on React, which is a framework that helps with making dynamic websites. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We would love for you to attend our workshops, but you can also feel free to just start working! One more note is that although you‚Äôre more than welcome to come to the event with a team already formed, we do have a team size limit of 5 people.</p>

                    <p>Once you've gotten a chance to work on your project for a couple of hours, you will be assigned a table, and will get to present your work during the project showcase. Then, we will choose winners for different categories and award our prizes.</p>
